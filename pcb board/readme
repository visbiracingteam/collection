I have designed boards related to the accumulator of a racing car. These boards need complete knowledge of eagle and PCB design related circuit analysis.
if you want to know about flex pcb and its application, I have done so in finding a solution for a flexible connection that we can add to the thermistor and cell module to connect with pcb board. It may be the solution to the split that we get during running of car.
